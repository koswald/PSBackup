# ChangeLog

Change log for the PSBackup project.

[Version 0.0]  

## Version 0.0

- Added version information. See [ProjectInfo.ps1].
- Added the Issues section to the [ReadMe.md].
- Improved integration tests.
- Added the `Remove-TestArtifact` function to the Utility module.
- Efforts to move toward a Linux port have been delayed, perhaps indefinitely, so `/` has been replaced with `\` in paths, even though PowerShell on Windows dealt with them just fine.
- Improved comments and documentation.
- Removed many trailing spaces on lines.
